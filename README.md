# BioSim

An Artificial Life simulator, with procedural terrain, weather, genetics, and other fun stuff.

## Quick Start

Currently in progress! Check back soon!

## Goals

 - [ ] Diverse and interesting procedural worlds.
 - [ ] Dynamic weather and season simulation.
 - [ ] Robust genetic system to support simple and complex organisms.
 - [ ] Intuitive UI for easy navigation, inspection, and customization.
 
 ### Stretch Goals:
 
 - [ ] A free portal to share and compare worlds and organisms.
 - [ ] Headless mode to run long term on a server.
 - [ ] Semi-open ended evolution system (neural networks, executable DNA, hybrid, etc).
